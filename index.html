<h1>News</h1>
Fake news takes many forms – propaganda, misinformation, deception to name some of the more insidious forms; gossip, tittle-tattle and rumour describes some of the less harmful ones. But this academic paper (Bronstein et al., 2019) describes fake news as:

“fabricated news stories that are presented as being from legitimate sources and promoted on social media to deceive the public for ideological or financial gain”

There has been a spike in ‘fake news’ related to coronavirus, and one might wonder what the point of this is. A fake report of a cure isn’t going to make any money, and it’s not going to make us vote for anyone, so why do it? This question gets to the bottom of the reason for the majority of fake news currently. One word: Clickbait. The rise of social media has created a whole new stream of revenue for unscrupulous word-peddlers. Your eyeballs are the product. Every time you click on a link, the owner of the website that it leads to gets money from advertisers. Take a look at the website of any tabloid ‘newspaper’ and you will see pictures with headlines like “You won’t believe how [insert name of has-been celebrity] looks now!” or “Supermodels use these simple tricks to look stunning in the morning”.
